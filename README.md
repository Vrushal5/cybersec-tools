# Cybersecurity Tools – Python 🐍

A growing collection of small but useful cybersecurity scripts:
- 🔍 `port_scanner.py`: Scan IP ranges with custom ports
- 🔐 `hash_checker.py`: Verify file integrity with SHA256
- 🧠 `password_strength_checker.py`: Rates password security based on entropy

All scripts are CLI-based with argparse. Clean and readable for fast deployment in any lab.
